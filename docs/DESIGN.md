# MilliyMock — platform design system

The platform is the logged-in product: a working tool, not a brochure. It is
deliberately a different visual world from the public landing (see
`PROJECT_MAP.md` → "The landing page"), which stays cream/black and expressive.

**Authority.** The approved Bosh sahifa mockup, `design-ref/dashboard-approved.png`.
It is a raster render, so values below are measured from it where geometry is
readable, and normalised where the render is noisy (an AI render's antialiasing
produces subpixel extremes like `#FF0001` that are not real values). Where this
file and the mockup disagree, the mockup wins — report the conflict.

Mode: **Operate**. Scanability, consistency and the real usage scene outrank
expression. Brand lives in precise details, not decoration.

## Measured from the mockup (1536×1024)

| Thing | Measurement |
|---|---|
| Sidebar width | 245px → **240px** implemented |
| Content padding | 40px left, 38px right → **40px** |
| Stat card row | 4 cards, ~292px wide, **16px** gaps, **186px** tall |
| Content column | 285 → 1498 = 1213px |
| Sidebar nav rhythm | ~61px per item |
| Active nav pill | 62px tall, fully rounded |

## Colour

The interface is neutral. Colour appears **only where it carries meaning**.
Never for decoration.

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `app-bg` | `#FCFBFA` | page background, warm off-white |
| `app-surface` | `#FFFFFF` | cards |
| `app-sunken` | `#F8F6F3` | a card inside a card (weekly goal) |
| `app-tile` | `#F7F4F1` | circular icon tiles, nav hover |
| `app-warm` | `#F4EFEB` | the one warm accent surface (quote band) |
| `app-ink` | `#0A0A0A` | primary text, active pill, primary button |
| `app-muted` | `#8A857F` | secondary text, labels, axis ticks |
| `app-border` | `#EFEBE6` | hairlines, card borders, sidebar divider |

Semantic — measured backgrounds, normalised foregrounds:

| Token | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `app-good` / `app-good-bg` | `#15803D` / `#E9F7EC` | improvement, strong score |
| `app-bad` / `app-bad-bg` | `#DC2626` / `#FEE3E2` | weak score |
| `app-info` / `app-info-bg` | `#5B4BD6` / `#EFEAFC` | in progress, being checked |
| `app-coin` | `#F5C23B` | **the coin icon only** |

Score thresholds: ≥70% good, <70% bad. In-progress states are info, never green.

## Type

Same family as the rest of the app (DM Sans). The platform does **not** use the
landing's Playfair — serif is the marketing voice.

| Role | Size / weight |
|---|---|
| Page greeting | 30px / 700 |
| Page subtitle | 15px / 400, muted |
| Card metric | 34px / 700 |
| Card label | 15px / 500 |
| Section heading | 20px / 700 |
| Body | 15px / 400 |
| Secondary / meta | 13px / 400, muted |

## Components

- **Card** — `app-surface`, radius 20px, `0 1px 2px rgba(16,15,14,.04), 0 8px 24px -12px rgba(16,15,14,.10)`, 24px padding. One shadow depth exists. Do not add a second.
- **Icon tile** — 48px circle, `app-tile`, thin (1.7) dark stroke icon inside. This is the only icon treatment.
- **Nav item** — 12px radius, icon + label; active is a solid `app-ink` pill with white text; hover is `app-tile`.
- **Pill button** — fully rounded; primary is `app-ink` on white text, secondary is `app-surface` with an `app-border` hairline.
- **Status badge** — fully rounded, semantic background + foreground pair, 13px/600.
- **Trend** — arrow glyph + percentage in `app-good`/`app-bad`, followed by muted context text.
- **Progress bar** — 6px, `app-border` track, `app-ink` fill.
- **Line chart** — inline SVG, `app-ink` 2px stroke, round joins, dots at each point, muted axis labels, faint area wash. No gridline chrome beyond horizontal ticks.
- **Subject mark** — 44px rounded-square (12px radius) on `app-tile` holding the subject's icon. Deliberately square, so it never reads as the circular icon tile: a circle is a *category* of thing, a square is a *specific subject*. *(Revised for Testlar — it previously held a single letter glyph, π/Δ/T. Once every subject had a real icon, a letter beside a calculator icon for the same subject read as two different systems.)*
- **Subject card** (`SubjectCard.vue`) — the Fanlar grid tile: 56px circular icon tile, name, what the subject covers, and the mock count on the card's baseline. The whole card is the link, never a card with a button inside it. Hover moves the card to `app-sunken` and the tile to white — no lift, because one shadow depth exists.
- **Skeleton** (`SkeletonBlock.vue`) — a pulsing `app-tile` block. Loading states are built by arranging these in the shape of the content that is coming, so nothing shifts when the data lands.
- **Test row** (`TestRow.vue`) — the long horizontal form of a mock: subject mark, the test's real title, `N savol • N ishlagan`, an optional PREMIUM badge, a status badge, and the primary action. **The action always starts a test**, because Testlar is where a student takes one — the same rule the public subject pages follow, where every card reads "Testni boshlash" whatever the student has done before. A finished test is offered again, not swapped for its result; results are Natijalar's job. The only exception is `progress`, which reads "Davom etish" and resumes the existing attempt so answers are not thrown away. Since every action is primary, every button is the ink one — none is the quiet secondary. State still drives the badge: `progress` → "Yechilmoqda", `done` → "Yakunlangan". The done badge is **neutral, not green** — the attempts endpoint returns a raw score with no maximum, so the row can say a test was finished but never how well; a coloured badge would imply a pass mark nothing measured. Below `sm` the status/action group takes its own full-width line. The row emits `action` rather than navigating, because starting a test can mean a confirm, a purchase or a top-up — the screen owns that. Shared by the dashboard and Testlar so a test looks identical wherever it appears.
- **Launch dialogs** (`TestLaunchDialogs.vue`) — the three confirmations between the row's button and the test: start, buy, top up. One component so every screen that lists tests asks the same questions in the same words. Built from the platform's own card/pill parts, not the naive-ui modal the public pages use.

## Rules

- No new colours, card shapes, shadow depths, fonts, or a second icon style.
  Subject icons live in `AppIcon.vue` with everything else, on the same 24 grid
  at the same 1.7 stroke, and are referenced by name from `subjects.js` — never
  inlined at a call site, or the set drifts.
- Colour never decorates. A card is not green because it is nice.
- Every list ships an empty state and a skeleton loading state in the shape of
  its content. Empty states use `EmptyState.vue` — name what is missing, say
  what will appear here, offer the one action that fills it. Distinguish *the
  student has none* ("Siz hali test yechmagansiz") from *the system has none*
  ("Hozircha test qo'shilmagan"); they are different facts and need different
  copy.
- Two empty states on one screen must not say the same sentence. Each names its
  own subject — the activity card covers tests, essays and courses, so it reads
  "Hozircha faoliyat yo'q", not "Siz hali test yechmagansiz".
- An empty screen must not carry invented figures. With no history the stat
  cards read 0 or em dash with no trend, and per-user state (a score, an
  in-progress flag) is stripped from test rows rather than shown against a test
  the student never opened.
- Uzbek (Latin) throughout: Bosh sahifa, Testlar, Essay tekshirish, Natijalar,
  Narxlar, Yordam, Sozlamalar, Community, tanga, savol, smena, Testni boshlash,
  Premium.
- If a screen needs a component this system lacks, build it from existing parts
  and record the addition here.
