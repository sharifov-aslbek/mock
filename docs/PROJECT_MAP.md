# MilliyMock frontend — project map

Vue 3.5 SPA (Vite 7, vue-router 4, Pinia, Tailwind 4, vue-i18n, naive-ui).
Backend is a separate .NET solution in `../backend`. Deployed via `Dockerfile`
(`serve -s dist -l 3000`) + `docker-compose.yml` — not Vercel.

## The wall: marketing vs platform

MilliyMock has two faces, and registration is the door between them.

- **Shop window** — anyone can see it. Landing page and marketing pages.
- **Workshop** — only registered users. Tests, results, essay checking.

The split is expressed as four **layout groups** in `src/router/index.js`, each
with a layout component in `src/layouts/`. (Next.js route groups have no
vue-router equivalent; nested layout routes are the idiomatic translation.)

| Group | Layout | Auth | Contains |
|---|---|---|---|
| marketing | `MarketingLayout.vue` | none — **no auth store, no session request** | `/`, `/natijalar`, `/platforma`, `/ai-tekshiruv` |
| public (legacy) | `PublicLayout.vue` | none (pages may be auth-*aware*) | `/narxlar`, subject pages, demos |
| platform | `PlatformLayout.vue` | **guarded** | `/test`, `/result-exam`, `/profile`, `/explanation` |
| auth | `BareLayout.vue` | none (`/complete-profile` requires auth) | `/login`, `/register`, `/verify-phone`, `/complete-profile` |

`App.vue` is now only global providers (`NMessageProvider`,
`NetworkStatusAlert`) + `<RouterView>`. The old `layoutlessRoutes` /
`supportlessRoutes` path arrays are gone; layouts read `meta.chrome` and
`meta.support` instead.

### Why two public groups

The subject pages stay public and indexed, but `SubjectPage.vue` /
`OnaTiliPage.vue` / `PricingPage.vue` are auth-*aware* (free vs premium state,
`AuthRequiredModal`, `PricingPaymentModal`) and keep the chrome they have today.
Only newly designed marketing pages get the new marketing shell. Moving them
into `MarketingLayout` would silently redesign them.

## Routes

### marketing — `MarketingLayout`
| Path | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `views/marketing/LandingPage.vue` | built from `MilliyMock Landing.dc.html` |
| `/natijalar` | `views/marketing/NatijalarPage.vue` | **placeholder.** Public success stories — *not* `/result-exam` |
| `/platforma` | `views/marketing/PlatformaPage.vue` | placeholder |
| `/ai-tekshiruv` | `views/marketing/AiTekshiruvPage.vue` | placeholder |

### public (legacy chrome) — `PublicLayout`
| Path | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/narxlar` | `views/PricingPage.vue` | was `/pricing` |
| `/pricing` | → `/narxlar` | client redirect; real 301 in `public/serve.json` |
| `/math` | `views/SubjectPage.vue` | `subjectKey: 'math'` |
| `/tarix` | `views/SubjectPage.vue` | `subjectKey: 'history'` |
| `/fizika` | `views/SubjectPage.vue` | `subjectKey: 'physics'` |
| `/biologiya` | `views/SubjectPage.vue` | `subjectKey: 'biology'` |
| `/biologiya/test` | `views/BiologyDemoPage.vue` | **DEV only** (offline reference for the AI-question UI); prod → `/biologiya`. `chrome: false`, `support: false`, noindex |
| `/ona-tili` | `views/OnaTiliPage.vue` | |
| `/ona-tili-demo` | → `/ona-tili` | |
| `/ona-tili-demo-natija` | `views/OnaTiliDemoResultPage.vue` | **DEV only**; prod → `/ona-tili` |
| `/mashq` | `views/MashqPage.vue` | **DEV only**; prod → `/` |

### app — `AppShell` (guarded)

The new platform chrome: fixed 240px sidebar, top bar, `docs/DESIGN.md`. Screens
move here one at a time as each is approved; the rest still render
`AppPlaceholderPage.vue` so every sidebar destination resolves.

| Path | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/dashboard` | `views/app/DashboardPage.vue` | approved — the reference screen. **Still placeholder data** |
| `/testlar` | `views/app/TestlarPage.vue` | the Fanlar grid — **live API** |
| `/testlar/:subject` | `views/app/SubjectTestsPage.vue` | one subject's mock list — **live API** |
| `/essay` | `views/app/EssayPage.vue` | essay checking — **live API** |
| `/tanga` | `views/app/NarxlarPage.vue` | balance, plans, tanga history — **live API** |
| `/community` | `AppPlaceholderPage.vue` | not designed yet |
| `/sozlamalar` | `AppPlaceholderPage.vue` | not designed yet |
| `/yordam` | `AppPlaceholderPage.vue` | not designed yet |

**Testlar is wired to the live backend** through `stores/testCatalog.js`:

| Request | Gives |
|---|---|
| `GET /test` | the catalogue — title, subject, question count, attempt count, premium flags |
| `GET /user-test-attempt/get-user-attempts` | this user's attempts, folded in as each row's `new` / `progress` / `done` state |

Both are fetched once and cached in the store, so moving between the grid and a
subject list does not re-hit the network. Rules that fall out of the real data:

- **The grid only shows subjects that have published tests.** It is derived from
  the catalogue, not a hard-coded list, so a new subject appears the moment its
  first test is published — and a student never opens a fan and finds nothing.
  At the time of writing that is Matematika (6), Tarix (4), Ona tili (3),
  Fizika (1), Biologiya (1). Kimyo, Geografiya, Ingliz tili and Informatika are
  in the registry but have no tests, so they do not render.
- **A subject the registry does not recognise is still shown**, under its raw
  backend name with a generic icon, so publishing a test under an unexpected
  subject string cannot make it vanish from the product.
- **No score percentage on a row.** `get-user-attempts` returns `totalScore`
  with no maximum, so a percentage would be invented. Rows say "Yakunlangan".
- **The token is sent on `/test`, not just on the attempts call.** `isPurchased`
  is per-user: anonymously every premium test comes back unpurchased, so
  without the header the screen would offer to sell a student a test they
  already own.
- **Drafts are filtered out client-side.** That same token means an admin
  account gets every draft back from `/test` too — 30 tests instead of 15 — so
  the store keeps only `status: Published`. The public subject pages do not
  need this because they never send a token.

**Essay tekshirish is wired too**, through `composables/useEssayCenter.js`:

| Request | Does |
|---|---|
| `GET /essay-topic` | the user's own topics plus the shared ones |
| `POST /essay-topic` — JSON `{ text }` | add one of your own |
| `DELETE /essay-topic?topicId=` | remove one of your own |
| `POST /essay-review/custom` — JSON `{ topicId, essay }` | grade a typed essay |
| `POST /essay-review/custom/images` | OCR photographed pages, then grade |
| `GET /essay-submission` | the OCR transcription, so highlights can anchor |

The review itself renders through `EssayAnalysisSection`, the shared
integration surface, so the grading UI cannot drift between the platform and
the public Ona tili tab.

`useEssayCenter` is a **separate implementation** from
`components/onatili/OnaTiliEssayCenter.vue`, not a refactor of it. That
component runs the live, paid essay flow for students today and the brief puts
the essay feature off limits, so it is untouched. Endpoints, limits and error
handling are mirrored deliberately; if the two ever disagree, that component is
the authority.

**Narxlar exists twice, on purpose.** `/narxlar` stays the public, indexed
marketing page for logged-out visitors. A signed-in user asking for it is sent
to `/tanga` by the global guard, because the marketing page carries the public
navbar and would drop them out of the platform shell. `/tanga` reads the
balance (`GET /api/balance`), the plans (the same i18n source the public page
uses, so a price cannot be right in one place and stale in the other) and the
tanga history (`GET /api/transaction`), and reuses `PricingPaymentModal` — the
live manual-activation flow with the real card number — rather than
reimplementing payment.

The dashboard is still placeholder — every figure there is marked `TODO(api)`,
and `?empty=1` previews its first-run state.

**Correction to an earlier note in this file:** a score percentage *is*
obtainable. `get-user-attempts` omits the maximum, but
`get-results?testAttemptId=` returns `maxScore` alongside `totalScore` (and
`correctCount` / `incorrectCount`) — one call per attempt. Test lists stay
without percentages because that would be one request per row, but the
dashboard's average and per-attempt results can use it.

### platform — `PlatformLayout` (guarded)
| Path | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/test` | `views/TestPage.vue` | `chrome: false`, `support: false` |
| `/result-exam` | `views/ResultExamPage.vue` | |
| `/result-exam/essay/:id` | `views/EssayResultPage.vue` | client-persisted essay analysis |
| `/profile` | `views/ProfilePage.vue` | |
| `/explanation` | `views/ExplanationPage.vue` | `chrome: false`, `support: false` |

All carry `meta.requiresAuth: true` and `robots: noindex, nofollow`.

### auth — `BareLayout`
`/login`, `/register`, `/verify-phone`, `/complete-profile` — all noindex.

Telegram and Google sign-in are one component, `components/auth/SocialAuthButtons.vue`,
rendered on both `/login` and `/register` (both providers create the account on
first sign-in, so they are a registration path too). It emits `authenticated`;
the page owns the redirect (`redirectAfterAuth` → `resolvePostAuthRoute`).

**TEMP (2026-08-16) — SMS is down again.** `PHONE_VERIFY_REDIRECTS_ENABLED = false`
in `utils/postAuth.js` switches off every redirect into phone verification
described below (post-auth detour to `/complete-profile`, start-test's 403
hand-off, login's `/verify-phone` hand-off; `/complete-profile` itself saves the
name/phone and finishes without an OTP). Registration by phone simply doesn't
complete meanwhile; signed-in users keep using the site. Flip it back to `true`
when SMS works again — nothing else needs to change.

`/complete-profile` (`views/CompleteProfilePage.vue`, `requiresAuth`) collects
the real name (printed on the certificate) and confirms the phone via
`POST /auth/verify-my-phone` → verify-otp. It is a redirect target, not a wall:
`utils/postAuth.js#resolvePostAuthRoute` sends a fresh session there after
login / register / verify-phone when `authStore.needsProfileSetup`, and every
start-test call site (`MathTestCard`, `TestPage`, `composables/useTestLauncher`)
sends the user there on the backend's 403 (`error.phoneNotConfirmed`, set in
`stores/test.js`) with `?redirect=` back to where they were. Google and
Telegram sign-ins land there every time — neither supplies a phone. The old
client-side `ProfileGateModal` / `useProfileGate` gate is gone.

## The guard

Enforced in **three** places; a router-only check is not a boundary.

1. `router.beforeEach` — global, on `meta.requiresAuth`.
2. `beforeEnter` on the platform group's parent route.
3. `PlatformLayout.vue` — re-checks on mount and watches the auth state, so a
   token cleared mid-session ejects the user.

All three redirect to `{ name: 'register', query: { redirect: to.fullPath } }`.
Registration — not login — is the existing door; that is unchanged.

Auth state is `Boolean(localStorage['milliymock_token'])`
(`stores/auth.js`) — a synchronous read, no session request on load.
`utils/authToken.js` exposes a network-free peek at the same key so the
marketing shell can swap its CTA without importing the auth store.

## Redirects

| From | To | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `/pricing` | `/narxlar` | `public/serve.json` (301, crawlers) + router (client) + `public/_redirects` |
| `/ona-tili-demo` | `/ona-tili` | router |
| `/mashq` (prod) | `/` | router |
| `/ona-tili-demo-natija` (prod) | `/ona-tili` | router |

## SEO

`utils/seo.js` (`applySeo`, wired to `router.afterEach`) rewrites title,
description, robots, canonical and OG/Twitter tags from each route's `meta.seo`.
Static defaults live in `index.html`. `public/sitemap.xml` lists the public URLs.

Known limitation: meta is client-rendered, so non-JS crawlers see only the
static `index.html` tags.

## The landing page

Built from the Claude Design file `MilliyMock Landing.dc.html` (project
`332e13cf-38f5-4341-9eb7-7282d0d51c3a`), read via the DesignSync tool. The
design-tool runtimes `support.js` and `image-slot.js` are not carried over.

- `views/marketing/LandingPage.vue` composes four section SFCs from
  `components/marketing/`: `LandingHero`, `LandingStats`, `LandingFeatures`,
  `LandingCta`. Chrome (`LandingNavbar`, `LandingFooter`) lives in
  `MarketingLayout` so it also wraps the other marketing routes.
- Design tokens (colors, the Inter/Playfair font stacks) are in the `@theme`
  block of `src/assets/main.css`. Do not hardcode the design's hex values in
  components.
- Fonts load the way the rest of the repo loads them — a Google Fonts `@import`
  in `main.css`. Inter and Playfair are applied per-element via `font-inter` /
  `font-display`; the platform stays on DM Sans.
- Images live in `src/assets/landing/` and are imported by the components, the
  repo's existing convention.
- **Containers use `box-content`.** The design was authored without a CSS reset,
  so its `max-width: 1280px; padding: 0 48px` means 1280px of *content*.
  Tailwind's preflight sets `border-box`, which would render 1184px instead.
  `box-content` restores the design's real proportions. Same for the CTA
  banner's inner `max-width: 520px; padding: 64px`.
- The four nav links are the design's own in-page anchors, written as `/#id`
  so they work from any marketing route via the router's `scrollBehavior`.

### How the landing images were prepared

The design project's `assets/` cannot be pulled through the DesignSync tool in
usable form — it returns base64, which is fine to read but not to reproduce
byte-for-byte. Both images were therefore derived from the sources in
`Desktop/Milliymock/newaspects/`, with the scripts kept out of the repo:

- `logo-lockup.png` — cropped out of `Artboard 3 (3).png`. The artwork's
  bounding box there is 820×195 at (130, 442); the design's asset is 836×211,
  i.e. that box with 8px padding, so those exact bounds were used. White was
  converted to alpha over a black fill, which preserves the antialiased edges.
- `dashboard-figure.png` — the raw render carries dead backdrop around the plate
  and that backdrop sits *behind* the design's `drop-shadow(...)`, so the shadow
  would trace a rectangle instead of the plate. Cropped to content and the flat
  backdrop keyed to transparent. **Replaced 2026-08-08** with a render of the
  rebuilt Bosh sahifa (stats → chart → kurslar → So'nggi testlar); now 1532×925,
  backdrop `#F6F3F0`.
  The key marches in from each row's ends and stops at the first sustained run
  of plate-bright pixels — a plain threshold combs the near-white sidebar, and
  a flood fill leaks through the plate's dark border. Row boundaries are then
  median-smoothed so the rotated rectangle's edges stay straight, and the
  plate's own shadow fades in by depth rather than being cut, so no outline
  appears where it ends.

### Known deviations from the design

- **Hero avatars.** The design's three avatars are design-tool placeholders
  pointing at randomuser.me. Rendered as empty circles by request, so real
  photos can drop in without any layout change.
- **Responsive.** The design defines no breakpoints. Chosen behaviour: hero
  collapses to one column below `lg`; stats and features go 4 → 2 → 1 columns;
  nav links wrap to a second row below `lg`; the CTA staircase becomes a
  bottom band below `sm` so it stops running under the text.
- **No SupportButton** on marketing routes — it is not in the design.
- **Footer year** reads 2026, not the design's 2025 (confirmed).
